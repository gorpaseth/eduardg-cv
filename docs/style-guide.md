# What Is a Style Guide? 
A style guide is a document including a set of rules that companies provide to their employees to achieve consistency in writing. In theory, a style guide helps a company's written output be neutral, professional, and correct. As of September 2017, Netcentric has not yet put in place a style guide. The following sections aim at developing the building blocks for a Netcentric style guide.

# American English
American English is the standard in international technical communication. UBS explicitly states that "US English is the UBS standard". 
In practice, the US - UK variety is mostly reflected in spelling differences.  
N.B. The Atlassian built-in spellchecker is set to British English by default. 
The following table provides an overview on the main spelling differences between American and British English.

Neither approach is right or wrong. However, from a language point of view, headline-style capitalization makes more sense, and is increasing.                                                                

## What Not to Capitalize
The following items should not be capitalized:
- any word for the sole reason of emphasizing it. For emphasis, use italic.
- the word "page" when followed by a number.
- the words "release" or "version" unless part of a product name.

# Writing Meaningful Headings
- Convey maximum of content with minimum of form.  
- Omiting articles in headlines is acceptable but less so in body text.  
- Headings must summarize the information included in the sections they preceede.  
- Place the most important word first.  
- Use parallel construction for the same level headings (e.g. Opening, Installing, Debugging).  
- Avoid beginning a heading with an article (the, a/an).

# Punctuation and Space
A period marks the end of a declarative or an imperative sentence.

One space should be used between two sentences, regardless of whether the first ends in a period, a question mark, an exclamation point, or a closing quotation mark or parenthesis.

One space should follow a colon [:]. Do **NOT** add a space before the colon.

- **Correct**: Applicants must provide the following documents: a valid driving licence, the car's insurance, and the application form.  
- **Incorrect**: Applicants must provide the following documents : a valid driving licence, the car's insurance, and the application form.

Do **NOT** add a space between the brackets and the words enclosed by brackets.

- **Correct**: This is the main information. (This is the optional information.)  
- **Incorrect**: This is the main information. ( This is the optional information. )

When an entire independent sentence is enclosed in brackets, the period belongs inside the closing bracket.
